All new members will be assigned the Bronze membership tier by default.
Members may upgrade to a higher tier based on accumulated points. 
Each tier offers benefits tailored to member preferences and needs.
Members will earn one point for every RM 10 spent at Starpark Lagoon.
A renewal fee applies annually for all membership tiers except for Bronze.
All membership tiers, including the Bronze membership, are subject to an annual renewal requirement.
Renewal of the Bronze membership tier is free of charge but must be activated each year to maintain membership status.
Members can renew their membership 30 days prior to or on the exact date of expiry.
Silver membership requires more than 300 points and an upgrade price of RM 50.
Golden membership needs customers to have more than 1000 points and pay RM100 to upgrade their membership.
Eligibility for upgrades is based on total points accumulated, irrespective of points redemption.
Members wishing to downgrade their membership may do so to the next lower tier upon renewal.
Our customer support team will contact members one week prior to membership expiration to remind them of the impending renewal.
If a membership expires, all accrued points will reset to zero, and Silver or Golden members will be downgraded to Bronze membership.
Members who wish to resubscribe to the previous membership tier are required to recollect the point and reach the point required to subscribe it.
Members may redeem rewards based on the points they have collected.
Rewards redeemed must be used immediately.
